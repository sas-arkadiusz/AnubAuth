# AnubAuth 🖤🔐

**AnubAuth** is a modular authentication and authorization library for Spring Boot applications.

Inspired by **Anubis**, the Egyptian god who guarded the gates to the afterlife, AnubAuth aims to protect the gates to your system — handling user authentication, JWT token management, and optional OAuth2 login (e.g. Google, Facebook) with clean, reusable Spring-based components.

## ✨ Features
- Stateless JWT authentication - coming soon
- OAuth2 login support (Google, Facebook, etc.) - coming soon
- Modular structure for easy integration into monoliths or microservices - coming soon
- Customizable token claims and security filters - coming soon
- Easy setup via Spring Boot auto-configuration - coming soon

## 💡 Use Case
AnubAuth is ideal for projects where:
- You want to manage auth logic outside your main domain
- You plan to reuse the auth module across multiple apps
- You prefer full control over JWT handling and roles
- You need a simple OAuth2 integration but don’t want to pull in large solutions like Keycloak

## 📦 Installation
Coming soon: Maven Central.

## 🚧 Status
